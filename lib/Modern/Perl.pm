package Modern::Perl;
# ABSTRACT: enable all of the features of Modern Perl with one import

use 5.010_000;

use strict;
use warnings;

use autodie ();
use mro     ();
use feature ();

sub import
{
    warnings->import();
    strict->import();
    feature->import( ':5.10' );
    mro::set_mro( scalar caller(), 'c3' );
}

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Modern Perl programs use several modules to enable additional features of Perl
and of the CPAN.  Instead of copying and pasting all of these C<use> lines,
instead write only one:

    use Modern::Perl;

For now, this only enables the L<strict> and L<warnings> pragmas, as well as
all of the features available in Perl 5.10.  It also enables C3 method
resolution order; see C<perldoc mro> for an explanation.  In the future, it
will include additional CPAN modules which have proven useful and stable.

See L<http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/01/toward-a-modernperl.html> for
more information, and L<http://www.modernperlbooks.com/> for further discussion
of Modern Perl and its implications.
